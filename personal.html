						<h3>Background</h3>
						<p>My mum and dad are both from Singapore, but I was born in Boise, ID. I grew up in Sammamish, WA which is a pretty quiet suburb that
						has a lot of exposure to Seattle's outdoorsy spirit. This culture of exploration and excellence defined a lot of my childhood, as I have fond
						memories of midday hikes and bike rides after dark. </br> 
						My dad's been working in the tech industry since before I was born which has been a huge influence on my interests and desired career.
						When I was younger and didn't understand how anything electronic worked, I thought everything that ran on electricity was magical. 
						Now that I've gained some experience with computers, I still think the field is pretty magical because Computer Science is able to continuously innovate as a field without borders.
						There's crossover into everything from medicine to assembly line construction! This is the crux of my desire to work in the field:
						I wish to make something both novel and useful enough to seem magical to others.</p>
						
						<h3>Hobbies</h3>
						<p>When I was a kid my parents sent me through the whole 
						asian kid gauntlet of activities, but nothing really caught on except swimming and assembling constructible sets. This would
						eventually translate into my two main high school activities. Most of my high school career was dominated by swimming for either 
						Issaquah Swim Team or Eastlake High School. Most weekdays I would spend up to 6 hours swimming. I was also involved in VEX Robotics 
						under Quantum 917F which was more of a weekly commitment. In college I am a member of the MIT Swim and Dive team, the MIT Poker Club, and I serve on the TedxMIT board.
						Recreationally, I enjoy reading fantasy/science fiction novels, playing poker, playing chess, and metalsmithing.</p>
						
						<h3>Family</h3>
						<p>Growing up as the middle child in a family with three boys was a pretty unique experience. I remember there being lots of squabbling, but it made
						me and my brothers very close. Dylan is currently a junior at Tesla STEM High who rows, and Bryan is working at Bloomberg in New York. Dad works at 
						Microsoft and mum is a homemaker. When we are together, we enjoy watching movies and playing Gears of War. Alongside my human family, I also have three 
						chihuahuas who I absolutely ADORE named Kirby, Cookie, and Oreo.</p>
